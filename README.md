 # Ux

 Rock in Class is a conceptual online music school that I conceived and developed a website for. The primary objective of the website is to provide users with the ability to explore available tutors, assess their offerings, and, if satisfied, create an account to schedule music classes.

 ## Design

 Upon discovering the name,  I opted for a modern and minimalistic design approach for the websiteâ€”something straightforward yet easily navigable.
 ### Colors
 The selected primary colors for the website.

 ### Wireframes

 I have created wireframes for the key pages of the site, utilizing Paint3D for the design. The following wireframes for the main pages:

- Home Page

 My objective with this project was to create a minimalist website, designed to showcase the tutors of the school's music department. I purposefully kept the page count to a minimum to prioritize and highlight the essential functionality.

- Tutors

 The tutors' wireframe is designed to display their pictures, provide a brief introduction, and detail the type of instrument and genre of music they specialize in.

- About

The wireframe for the "About" page includes our contact information and provides a brief overview of who we are.

- Sign up

The signup wireframe is straightforward, requiring only your username, email, password, and password confirmation.

- Sign in

The sign-in wireframe is uncomplicated, requesting only your username and password for authentication.

- Profile

Within the profile wireframe, you can view your bookings, as well as edit (reschedule) or delete them as needed.

# User story and Agile

## User Story

I have established Epics for every essential feature outlined in my scope. Here are the projected user stories associated with each of them:

### Admin management

 - As an **admin** I can **log in to the admin panel** so that **I can manage/see the panel**.

- As an **admin** I can **manage the booking that was made by a student** so that I can **delete or reschedule the appointment**.
- As an **admin** I can **manage the tutor profile in the admin panel** so that I can **delete, update, or add a new tutor**.

### Student account

- As a **student** I can **create an account** so that I can **save my preferences**.

- As a **student** I can **receive a message in the website** so that I am **aware that the registration process is correct**.
- As a **student** I can **log out** so that I **keep my account information secure**.

### Manage booking

- As a **student** I can **log in** so that I can **view my profile or edit it**.

- As a **student** I can **select the date, time and tutor** so that I can **book a class**.

- As a **student** I can **manage my booking** so I can **reschedule or delete the booking**.

#### The user story that is label as Won't have is:
 - As a **student** I can **reset my password** so that I can **change my password if I forget**.

 This might be implemented in the future. Currently, if a student forgets their password, they should reach out to the school for assistance, as indicated on the website.

## Agile development


I initiated this project in a GitHub Projects Page to monitor and organize the anticipated workload. The goal was to outline the expected tasks, categorize them into epics, and further break them down into user stories or manageable tasks. This structured approach aimed to facilitate progress and ensure timely completion of the website.
